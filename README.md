# About Me
Junior Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in end-to-end web application development, capable of managing both backend logic and frontend interaction. Skilled in building RESTful APIs using Java and Spring Boot, following design principles such as SOLID, Clean Code, and layered architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clean development practices.

On the frontend, experienced in using Angular and TypeScript to develop interactive, accessible, and well-structured interfaces with smooth integration to backend services.

Familiar with professional development and deployment environments, including Docker for containerization, Git for version control, and GitHub for collaborative code management. Comfortable working in agile environments using tools such as Jira and Trello for task planning and workflow tracking. Also experienced with Figma for interpreting UI/UX designs and translating them into functional frontend components.
